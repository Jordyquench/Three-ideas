# Touched with contempt #

(Motion comic)

**Overview**

My children have always wanted a dog – I don’t – but, as the old saying goes: “Touched with contempt” ~ Working title

I have recently been getting into motion design and this idea came to me when I seen some opening credits on a game I was playing.

A motion comic with an interactive feel, giving the user choices throughout the story which makes them feel immersed within the world.

Right now I am stuck between 2 genres, A film noire style, or a fantasy story, they both have aspects that sway me, I love the colour style and assets that I would get to use in the film noire style, but the idea of creating a fantasy world really intrigues me.

If I went for a film noire style, there are then two styles within that, there is a classic feel, Shawn Martinbrough is the kind of style I would want to go for, and if I went with more of a modern look I would go for something that is similar to Sebastien Plassard’s work.

One thing I do know is what I want the underlying message to be. I want it to be about contempt, with the suicide rate drastically increasing and mental health issues being so prominent right now, I want to show what contempt can do to people, whatever the style ends up being if I can get this message across it will be worth it. That is also why I have tried to get contempt into the title (Even thought right now it is subject to change).  

The motion comic will either be an application designed for tablets or a web based comic, but there will also need to be a website to market the project, along with social media assets and physical merchandise (like t-shirts or stickers for example).

I would love to create my own score for the comic as well, it is something I have little to no experience in, but I think creating my own music would be a challenge, and a challenge I would like to undertake.

**Pros**

- I love the idea of a motion comic, while doing some initial research I seen some examples and they were so intriguing, they just have so much potential, I am surprised they aren’t more mainstream right now. 
- I have an understanding of adobe illustrator, photoshop and after effects which would be programs I would need to use it designing this project.
- The meaning behind this idea, Contempt, I feel like it has a strong message that would be influential in helping give the story purpose.

**Cons**

- Although I put after effects in a pro, it could also be a con just for the simple fact that my knowledge isn’t as vast as I would like, but this is something I would love to challenge myself in. I have been trying to grow my skills in this field throughout my placement year and this project would be the perfect way for me to take this further.
- What would I do if I decided to actually build it? I did some initial research by asking a developer in work about the logistics of this and they did give me hope that it wouldn’t be too confusing, so again this would be something I would like to test myself in. 
- A potential problem is whether or not I use voice in my comic? Do I go with voice acting or do I keep 

**How might it be built?**

The main thing would be the motion comic itself, like I said before, it would be either a web based application, or an application designed and build for a tablet, I think a phone would be too small to get the full experience.

I would do the initial designs on either Illustrator or Photoshop, depending on what the design is, then take those stills into after effects where the motion would be added.

When it comes to building the app itself, going by what the developer told me, it would have to be done using iframes, then export the animations as .json files from after effects, which I have a small amount of experience in.   

**Who’s it for?**

The target audience I am aiming this at would be teenagers/young adults, around or above the age of 15, I think this would be the perfect age to get my message across, and the art style and tone of the comic I could get across with that age is what I am imaging in my head.

**What’s the business model?**

My first though for the business model would be to create the comic in an episodic style, maybe a 5 part series, lasting about 5-10 mins or so each.

In terms of a price point I think making the first episode free and then you can get the others through in-app purchases, would be ideal for me. 

# Save the turtles #

(Campaign)

**Overview**

My children have always wanted a dog – I don’t – but, as the old saying goes: “I don’t have a title for this one yet”

There are a lot of problems in the world right now, obviously I can’t tackle them all, but if I could make a small change it would give me a sense of fulfilment and if everybody did the same, it wouldn’t be too long until we all start to see a real difference.

I think by trying to tackle something that I can really get behind would be a good start, so a campaign that brings light to the pollution that is being spilled into our oceans at an astonishing rate and killing thousands of sea creatures is so important.

Although I have the title of save the turtles, it isn’t necessarily just turtles, this is happening everyday and something needs to be done. I appreciate restaurants like McDonalds and Nandos for example are getting rid of plastic straws, so we need to get not only more restaurants on board with this but trying to cut out so many more things that there are eco friendly alternatives.

I would love to create a campaign that tries to bring this to light, coming at it from a lot of different angles, for example, an infographic, short animations and graphics for social media, a series of posters, a website and even physical products like t-shirts and badges/stickers (all created using eco friendly materials of course).

I could create a mascot that stays consistent throughout all of the different mediums, something that keeps people interested. Also, when it comes to a style for this, originally I thought a heavily illustrated style would work well, but now I think a more dark tone would be better, just for the fact that using more ‘real’ images would show people the damage it really is doing to our oceans, pulling on the heart strings a bit.  

**Pros**

- It is a great cause, these types of things need to be brought into the light of day, I think the attitude most people have is “out of sight, out of mind” which is not the way to see these types of issues (or any issues to be honest).
- I would be able to dip my feet into a plethora of aspects to design, illustration, photography, animation, motion design, web design and product design, as well as creating all of this I would be doing the marketing for it as well, so using facebook and instagram ads, setting up social media pages and designing a brand.

**Cons**

- This idea would have a lot of work, which itself in not a con, its just I would have to set achievable goals, I know the campaign is a great cause but I have to remember it is just me, and running an entire campaign myself could be a bit too much, but I could see this as a challenge, and I do love a a challenge.
- Marketing is not a skill which I possess, so learning this could be difficult, but there are plenty of people on the marketing team in my work I could ask for assistance.

**How might it be built?**

As I said before, there would be various different assets that would need to be build, I would have a website as the sort of hub, with infographics, social media ads, posters, graphics, motion graphics, video and physical products.

**Who’s it for?**

Kids and young adults, around 10-21 (that could maybe be tightened a bit, it is quite a broad range), because this is next generation, you want them to be aware young of the damages they could cause by not recycling and using eco friendly products.

**What’s the business model?**

This is a bit different from my first idea in this regard, It would be a free campaign but maybe the option at the start for some crowd funding to get the money for ads and to create the physical products, even if the crowd funding (Gofundme page?) had some exclusive gifts that the people who donated would receive, this might up the likelihood of people donating in the first place.

# Virtual Mannequin #

(Application)

**Overview**

My children have always wanted a dog – I don’t – but, as the  “Virtual Mannequin”

Have you ever been shopping online and see something you like the look of, a t-shirt for example? But you want to know what it would look like with either some other piece of clothing you own or something else you seen while shopping. This app would address this by having a virtual mannequin that you could add clothes to and build your outfit before you actually buy any of it.

I usually think AR is a bit gimmicky but I think if it was done right in this app it could be really useful, you could aim your phone just in front of you and you could see the mannequin modelling your clothes, so a real to size person. During the on boarding you will put in your body dimensions in and this will determine your model.

The plan would be to get online retailers such as top man and JD on board so that once you have all your items chosen you can add them all to a cart within the app and one payment will pay each of the retailers, and you will receive all of your items in one shipment (This last part may be a bit ambitious). 

**Pros**

- The main reason I would like to do this is because it is something I would actually use. There has been times like going on holiday for example, that I have seen something like a funky shirt, but not sure if I have any shorts that would look right with it, so this would let me check before I buy.
- I feel like I could get retailers on board with this, I think the idea of collaborating with other retailers could be good for business. 

**Cons**

- Building this app will be a challenge, creating a design for pretty much every piece of clothing online may be a bit ambitious.  
- The AR aspect wouldn’t be something I have any experience with, but then again the challenge of trying to figure it out would be really fun.

**How might it be built?**

I am still unsure whether I would be able to build this app, or just create it as a concept, I would go about designing it within illustrator and photoshop, maybe adding some animated aspects in after effects.

When it comes to developing it I would have to do a lot of research on app development, I have some friends in work who could help me get started with this research.

**Who’s it for?**

Id say anyone “could” use this app, but that is not the target audience. When it comes to online shopping I know that it would be more of a younger audience that do it. Therefore I would be aiming to target 16-50 year olds, this doesn’t mean people over the age of 50 couldn’t use this app, but the majority of people over this age don’t shop online as much as younger people.

**What’s the business model?**

If I was able to build this app, the App Store is where I would like to get it. I thought initially about making it a paid app, but I think making it free and just placing ads within the app would be a better business model. Looking at apps nowadays there are far more that are free to purchase but have ads, rather than an initial purchase.
